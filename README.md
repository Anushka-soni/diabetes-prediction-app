#  Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning

# Project Description
A web-based application that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical input parameters.  
This app uses two machine learning models — Random Forest and Gradient Boosting — and displays predictions and accuracy from both simultaneously.

# Features
- Input form for user medical data
- Predicts diabetes status using two ML models
- Displays predictions and model accuracies side by side
- Built with Streamlit for an interactive frontend

# Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- streamlit
- plotly
- scikit_learn
- joblib 
- statsmodels
